## **Result Evaluation System for Students' Academic Growth Tracking**



### **Objective**

The project is an **Evaluation System of Result** which aims for easy viewing of results by students and for teachers to upload marks for each subject. It also has a **graph** (Ogive line) in which students can see the progress of their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) through semesters.

The whole process of checking results is made smooth, clear and fast. The **Incremental SDLC Model** is used in developing this system stepwise. 

---

Why Adopt the Incremental Model? 

We have adopted the **Incremental Model** due to the reasons listed below:

1. **Fast Delivery**: Early availability of crucial features.

2. **Frequent Feedback**: Improvement of the system after every stage based on feedback of student and teacher.

3. **Lower Risk**: Minor changes can be made without affecting the whole system, so it can be fixed fast.

4. **Scalability**: New features may be added without affecting the existing system.

### Project Scope

The system will benefit the following:

1. **Students**:

	- View their semester results online.

	- Plot a graph showing improvements in CGPA.

2. **Teachers**:

	- Upload the marks of subjects.

	- Calculation of CGPA for students will be automated.

3. **Administrators**:

	- Administrating access to the system by users. 



 Projects such as attendance recording and notifications are yet to be undertaken.

### **Steps to Build the System**

1. Requirement Analysis
- Find out what is required in the system from the students and teachers.
- Add to the list important feature specifications like:
	- Showing the results online.
 	- Adding graphs for monitoring the CGPA.

2. System Design
- Make a **plan** for the system.
- Designing of a database to store:
 - Student results
 - User Information
 - CGPA Data

3. Incremental Development
We will be developing the system in very small steps.
- Step 1: Student Dashboard.
  - Students log in and access their results, with an added graph showcasing the improvements made on their CGPA.
- Step 2: Teacher Dashboard.
  - Teachers can input marks for various subjects, and the system will then automatically compute the CGPA.
- Step 3: Ogive Graph.
  - Provides a detailed graph of CGPA changes during semesters.

---

### **Testing**
- **Unit Testing**: Its testing includes every individual part that confirms to work.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests whether all parts operate.
- **User Testing**: Let the students and teachers use the system to evaluate feedback.
- **Performance Testing**: Performance of the system to be expected even when there are many users operating it.

---

### **Deployment and Maintenance**
- The system will become operational after completion of the particular step.
- Feedback gathering and fixing any errors.
- New features added upon request of the user.

---

### **Specifications for Key Features**

1. **Student Dashboard**:

  - Results are easy and safe to access.

  - Graph showcasing CGPA improvements.

2. **Teacher Dashboard**:

  - Marks are entered for the students.

  - Automatic calculation of CGPA.

3. **Ogive Graph**:

  - A clear and simple graph of academic growth.

### **How this Project will be Useful**

- **User Focused**: Regular feedback would keep student and teacher requirements in line for usability.

- **Faster Implementation**: Important functionalities were released much earlier.

- **Easy to Maintain**: Fixing of problems and addition of new features go through without any hitch. 



This system is intended to simplify, clarify, and make effective the management of academic results for all concerned.
